This project is one that gives the user a number of prompts and allows them to get a password at the end of it

This code works very well, but on the inside it feels like a mess.
There are a number of cool things I did to make it work well, but especially at the end, it felt like the ellegance factor turned into nothing.

The basic flowchart goes
1: it asks you total length
2: it asks you lengths of individual aspects
3: it asks you what exactly you want in those aspects
4: if the total length and the length of the aspects added up don't match, it asks you to give it any character.
5: Password is generated

It would have been interesting and a neat addition to ask the user if they wanted the app to generate random text, but the user story I was given seemed like it was primed toward the user actually choosing, and adding a random element would just add clutter. 
Maybe I can revisit this later when I'm not just usign promt() alert() and actually get a more solid foundation down for expanding this.
